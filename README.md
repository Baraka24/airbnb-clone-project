# Airbnb Clone Project

This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to demonstrate core functionalities such as property listings, user authentication, booking management, and search features. It serves as a learning tool for web development concepts and best practices using modern technologies.

## UI/UX Design Planning

The user interface is crafted to provide a clean and intuitive experience, closely resembling the look and feel of the original Airbnb platform. Emphasis is placed on responsive layouts, accessible navigation, and visually appealing components to ensure usability across devices. Modern UI frameworks and design principles are applied to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
